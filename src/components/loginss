Thought for a couple of seconds


Could you tell me a bit more about what you have in mind?

* What technology stack are you using (e.g. Spring Boot with Hibernate, Node/Express, React, etc.)?
* Do you need both sign‑in and sign‑up flows, plus things like password reset?
* Is this for a web app, mobile app, or something else?

With those details I can give you a tailored step‑by‑step guide.
